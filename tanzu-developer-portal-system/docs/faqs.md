Here are some common questions people have about the VMware® Tanzu Developer Portal™.

??? question "Which Backstage Plugins Can I Use With Tanzu Developer Portal?"
    As a general principle, we aim to make any Backstage plugin compatible with Tanzu Developer Portal. Our Tanzu Portal Builder tool operates with “surfaces” that inform how a plugin’s code should be integrated into the portal. As of the initial release, we are enabling the most commonly used surfaces. For more information, please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/index.html).
